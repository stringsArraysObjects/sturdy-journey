//PARAMETERS:   Inputs are always positive and > 0
//RESULT:       create a function that checks if a number n
//              is divisible by two numbers x and y.
//              return (true/false)
//EXAMPLE:      1) n =   3, x = 1, y = 3 =>  true because   3 is divisible by 1 and 3
//PSEUDOCODE:   use modulus, equality operators, and conditional operators for short circuit behavior
